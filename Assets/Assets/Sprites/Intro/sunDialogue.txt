You have awoken me from dark slumber
I, the godess of light
shall provide you what I can
In hopes you help give the world light again

Be still to use this newfound power
Press X and see the darkness cower
Sing your song through this cave of night
And guide you I shall with my light

Press Z to let me go and see
What's in store in front of thee
Do it once more,
and by your side I shall be
