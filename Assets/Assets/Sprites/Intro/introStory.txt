A long time ago, their existed a benevolent goddess of light who watched over the world.

Under the goddess's protection, life thrived and the world was in what seemed like an endless 
era of prosperity.

To show their gratitude, people created songs about the goddess and the
light that she blessed the world with.

But one day, a being of pure malice consumed the goddess and plunged the world
into everlasting darkness. 

Without the goddess's light, crops refused to grow and wildlife began to perish.

Starved for resources, people began to turn on each other, sparking long and bloody
wars that ravaged the land.

Those who were deemed incapable of fighting were left to die in elaborate cave structures.

As the world slowly delved into chaos, the old songs that honored the goddess began to fade,
as many people began to accept their fate of being consumed by the darkness
